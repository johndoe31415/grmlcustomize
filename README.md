# grmlcustomize
These are some simple scripts that customize the [Grml
Linux](https://www.grml.org) distribution ISO images. Grml is an extremely nice
rescue Linux image. A particularly cool feature is that the ISO images can
equally serve as dd-able data that you can just put on a USB stick and they
just work. I've not seen that anywhere and it's an *amazing* feature.

Anyways, this unpacks the squashfs, executes some customization hooks and
repacks an ISO.
